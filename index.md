## About Me

Hey there! I'm pursuing a doctoral degree in Biomedical Engineering (BME) in the [Reker Lab](https://rekerlab.pratt.duke.edu/) at Duke University. My research broadly focuses on machine learning and drug development.

- **Machine Learning**
  * *Kernel design* to suggest synthesis condition of nanodrug
  * *Active learning* to refine nanoparticle design in low data regime
  * *Transfer learning* to leverage prior knowledge for nanotherapeutics optimization
    
- **Nanoparticle Drug Delivery Design**
  * *Targeted nanoparticle* to achieve desired nanoparticle biodistribution
  * *Tripartite nanoparticle* to repurpose and enhance the efficacy of cargo drugs
  * *Tunable nanoparticle* to formulate hard-to-encapsulate drugs and reduce excipient usage

- **Lab Automation,** **Molecular Dynamics Simulation**
