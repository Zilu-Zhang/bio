## About Me

Hey! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the [Reker Lab](https://rekerlab.pratt.duke.edu/) in the Department of Biomedical Engineering (BME) at Duke University. My research broadly focuses on machine learning and the design of nanoparticle drug delivery systems.

- **Machine Learning**
  * *Kernel design* to suggest optimal synthesis condition of nanodrug
  * *Active learning* to efficiently iterate nanoparticle design in low data regime
  * *Dimensionality Reduction* to identify critical design factors of efficacious nanotherapeutics
    
- **Nanoparticle Drug Delivery Design**
  * *Targeted nanoparticle* to achieve desired nanoparticle biodistribution
  * *Tripartite nanoparticle* to repurpose and enhance efficacy of cargo drugs
  * *Tunable nanoparticle* to formulate hard-to-encapsulate drugs and reduce excipient usage
